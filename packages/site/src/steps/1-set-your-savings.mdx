# Choose how much you want to save.

Each payday, the amount you’ve chosen will be automatically transferred to your Emergency Fund. Effortless, automated savings that will add up over time!  

And you’re always in control. You can change your contribution amounts or pause for a week or two—it’s up to you.

Set your Starter Savings goal. Once you reach this, you can set another goal.
